/*
** JAVASCRIPT ENGINES **

  The first engine was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape Navigator
  It was called SpiderMonkey, and is still used in Firefox today
  SpiderMonkey is written in C++ and was originally interpreted
  Later, SpiderMonkey was the first engine to use JIT (Just In Time) compilation

  V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute

  V8 engine was created in 2008 by Google for use in Chrome
  Google was having trouble with JavaScript performance for Google Maps and Gmail

  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
